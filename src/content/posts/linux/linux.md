> ### I have tried these three DEs
>  - Gnome
>  - KDE
>  - XFCE

- First time trying Gnome with Ubuntu (downloaded ISO from website and install~), it's so pretty and most compatible with my devices, smoothing experience aka Memory waster

- I had decided to move to Debian KDE Plasma (after watching the comparison video of some guys on Youtube), which was overwhelming with the ability to customize KDE features, and it's more lightweight than Gnome xD

- XFCE seems to fit with my X220 (4GB, 128GB 2.5inch SSD, i5 2th) but it lacks the functions that I need

**[Update: 20 June 24]**: Seem i have fall in love with the ricing process, i'm using bspwm and i3 now :) should i move to Arch with Hyperland xD

**[Update: 24 June 24]**: Back to using Gnome Debian (there some issue with my KDE + bspwm), but another session still bspwm xD

**[Update 30 June 24]**: I have moved to Arch with Hyprland, my first time using Arch, and it's so fun to rice my system xD

# OSS (Open Source Software)
- OSS is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance
- React: https://github.com/facebook/react
- fzf (fuzzy file finder): https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

Many many many tools are open source now :)

# Linux History

![Alt text](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dxs4O0DWsAE2MS7.jpg)

- 1984: The GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation
	- Create open source version of UNIX utilities
	- Create the General Public License (GPL): Software license enforcing open source principles
- 1991: Linus Tovarlds
	- Creates open source, UNIX-like kernel, released under the GPL
	- Ports some GNU utilities, solicits assistance online
- Today:
	- Linux kernel + GNU utilities = complete, open source, UNIX like operating system
		- Packaged for targeted audiences as distributions

- Linux Kernel Repository: https://github.com/torvalds/linux, i really want to have a chance to contribute to this repo

# Linux Principles
- Everything is a file (Include Hardware)
- Small Single purpose Programs
- Ability to chain programs together for complex operations
- Avoid Captive User Interface
- Configuration data stored in a text file

![Alt text](https://i.redd.it/hbms08i9y1i91.jpg)

# Why Linux?

- Opensource
- Community Support
- Support Wide Variaty of Hardware
- Customization
- Most Servers runs on Linux
- Automation
- Security (debatable topic, depend on you)

# Architecture of Linux ![Alt text](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Linux-Architecture-1024x728.png)

- Linux Kernel read, understand the hardware CPU, RAM, pass signal to Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish,...) 

# Popular Linux Distributions (distros)

# Package manager
- A  **package manager** in Linux is a tool that automates the entire process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software. You can think of it as an "app store" or a personal assistant for your operating system's software.

```

# Commands

- Most used commands:

  - **cd** : Change directory
    - `cd /home/user`
    - `cd ~`
    - `cd ..`

  - **ls** : List files and directories
    - `ls`
    - `ls -l` | `ls -al`
    - `ls -a`
    - ls -lt : sort time descending
    - ls -ltr: sort time ascending (r = reverse)

  - **pwd** : Print working directory

  - **cat**
    - `cat file.txt`

  - **cp** : Copy files and directories
    - `cp file.txt file2.txt`
    - `cp -r dir1 dir2`
    - `cp * /usr/share/.fonts`

  - **mv** : Move files and directories
    - `mv file.txt /usr/share/.fonts`
    - `mv file.txt file2.txt`
    - `mv * /usr/share/.fonts`
    - we can perform the rename file or directory by mv command: if i want to rename the file demo.txt to test.txt
    ```bash
    mv demo.txt test.txt
    # same as directory
    ```

  - **rm** : Remove files and directories
    - `rm file.txt`
    - `rm -r dir1`
    - `rm -rf dir1`

  - **mkdir** : Make directories
	  - mkdir /hihi
	  - mkdir /hihi/hehe/huhu => No such file or directory => mkdir -p /hihi/hehe/huhu ok
- Because normal mkdir only support one directory, if pass parent/child/... it cause error -> using -p (parent) to fix

  - **echo** : Write text to file
    - `echo "Hello World" > file.txt`
    - echo "alias 'yt=ytfzf -t'" >> ~/.bashrc
    - echo "alias 'll=ls -al'" >> ~/.bashrc
    - echo "alias 'showdisk=cd /media/lcaohoanq/ ; ls -al'" >> ~/.bashrc

  - **touch** : Create file
    - `touch file.txt`

  - **nano** : Text editor
    - `nano file.txt`

  - **unzip** : Unzip files
    - `unzip file.zip`

  - **tree** : Show the current directory with the tree visualization
    ```bash
    # show everything
    tree

    # show directories only
    tree -D

    # show directories except the pattern
    tree -I "node_modules"

    # show except the pattern, directories only
    tree -I "node_modules" -D
    ```

- **history**: Show all previously executed command

- Check CPU:
	- **nproc**
	- **lscpu**
	
- Check RAM
	- **free -h**
	- **cat /proc/meminfo**

- Power Management

```bash
# reboot
sudo reboot

# shutdown after 1 min
sudo shutdown -h

# shutdown immediately
sudo shutdown -h now

# schedule shutdown after 10 mins
sudo shutdown -P +10
```

# [Advanced command]
  - chmod [arguement] : give a file specific permission
    - +x : can executable
    - 777 : give all permission (do not recommend to use)
    - 400 : read only

  - ps: show process id
    ```bash
    ps aux | grep "obs"
    ```

# File System
- /: root directory
- /boot
- /dev
- /usr
-

# File Permissions

- Every directory have permission for owner and group
	- Owner is who created the file or directory
	- Groups is the set of users who share the same permission

![](https://z5.kerneltalks.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/File-permissions-in-Linux-Unix.png)

> - : executable file
   r : read
   w: write
   x: execute
- `-rw-r--r--`: 
	- owner user: can read, write, not execute (for each file the owner is root, oracle9, user3)
	- group user: can read only
	- other user: can read only

-  rwx (**user**)    rwx  (**group**)   rwx (**other**)

## chmod

> change file permissions
 
 ```zsh
chmod [u/g/o][+/-/=][r/w/x][file]
```

- Syntax:
	- **u/g/o**: user/group/other
	- **+/-/=**: add, remove, set
	- **r/w/x**: read, write, execute

- Change file `data.txt` add groups permission writable

```zsh
chmod g+w data.txt
```

- Using octal notation
	- Easy to figure out what number: https://chmod-calculator.com/
```zsh
chmod 664 foo.txt
```
- Syntax:
	- **u/g/o**: 6 6 4
	- read and write: 6, read: 4

- Be careful with `chmod 777`, grant full access, convenience but it violate the principle of privilege

# Text Editor

- nano and vim, let's go

## nano

<img width="645" height="339" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fd45886-f2a2-4d31-8414-ad779d75c683" />

### Install

```zsh
sudo apt-get install nano
``` 

### Command

- Vim has 3 mode
	- Normal: **default**, navigate, simple edit 
	- Insert: as the name, using as insert character
	- Command Line: saving, exiting,...

### Command

- Copy 1 line (yanking)
```zsh

- Jump to specific line (Normal mode), type line number with capital G -> Enter
```zsh
118796G
```

- Search word (Command mode -> **ESC**), / then type the keyword want to search -> Enter
```zsh

```zsh
$
```

- Exit (Command mode -> **ESC**)
	- q stand for quit
	- w stand for write
```zsh
:q! #force exit without saving
:wq #save and exit
```

### LazyVim

- Currently im using LazyVim (https://www.lazyvim.org/), it really easy to setup, and support a lot of LUA plugins there, but before going to something comfortable, make sure you have a basic or good foundation of vim, take time to practice :)

# File Types

- Regular file
	- **-**: Normal files such as text, data, or executable files
- Directory
	- **d**: Files that are lists of others files
- Link
	- **l** : A shortcut that points to the location of the actual file
- Special file
	- **c**: Mechanism using for input and output, such as file in /dev
- Socket
	- **s**: A special file that provides inter-process networking protected by the file system's access control
- Pipe
	- **p**: A special file that allows processes to communicate with each other without using network socket semantics

# Symbolic links

- Like desktop shortcut in windows
```zsh
ln -s source destination

unlink destination
```

# Filter & IO redirection command

## Grep

- Find text from any text input

![Alt text](https://www.cyberciti.biz/media/new/faq/2007/08/grep-command-examples-for-Linux-and-Unix-users-1.png)


- Usecase 1: We have sample file **0_Run predefined test cases.txt** contain the log from Github Action CI pipeline. Search error logs find the error. Problem is the file are too long (10k ~ line), and we are in server, we not have any IDE to use.
- Find text contain "Exception"
```zsh
grep "Exception" 0_Run predefined test cases.txt
``` 

- Syntax:
	- grep "key_word" -param file_name 

- Param
	- R: search recursively
	- n: show line number

- Usecase 2: Find the export port of docker container name pgadmin. We can easily use **docker ps** then use eyes to look for the pgadmin container. But when the number of container become 50, 100 or even more. Using **docker ps** and search manually make you look silly :).

- Search with grep + pipe operator **|**
```zsh
❯ docker ps | grep pgadmin
7ed17a84f912   dpage/pgadmin4   "/entrypoint.sh"         12 days ago   Up 39 minutes             443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5050->80/tcp, [::]:5050->80/tcp   pgadmin
```

# Bash Scripting

![](https://images.viblo.asia/9b6edd8b-83d6-499f-ab57-25502231bf23.png)

- Instead of doing manually command in Linux enviroment, we use text file to automate day to day regular tasks, that text file tell system run each command we defined. 
- We have many cool tools outside: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, SaltStack, Terraform why to learn Bash script
> Many concept derived from bash script concepts

- - `firstscript.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash

### This script prints system info ###

echo "Welcome to bash script"
echo

# Checking system uptime
echo "###############################"
echo "The uptime of the system is:"
uptime
echo

# Memory utilization
echo "###############################"
echo "Memory utilization"
free -m
echo

# Disk utilization
echo "###############################"
echo "Disk utilization"
df -h
```
- Now we execute `firstscript.sh`

```bash
❯ nvim firstscript.sh
❯ ./firstscript.sh
zsh: permission denied: ./firstscript.sh
❯ chmod +x ./firstscript.sh
❯ ./firstscript.sh
Welcome to bash script

###############################
The uptime of the system is:

- `websetup.sh`: script for host a website
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install on CentOS
# sudo yum install wget unzip httpd -y
# -y continue to install the relate pakage if not install

# I don't want to see that much infomation about installing package
sudo yum install wget unzip httpd -y >/dev/null
# Redirection: error, generate some output, if not error put to /dev/null

sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

# Why use -p tag
# -p: mean parent, without -p, will throw error
# without -p will create only one level directory
mkdir -p /tmp/webfiles

cd /tmp/webfiles

# Download this zip using wget, can use curl,...
wget https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2098_health.zip
unzip 2098_health.zip

# cp - r: recursive, copy all file, subfiles, folder
# source: all unzip file inside 2098_health to /var/www/html/
cp -r 2098_health/* /var/www/html/

systemctl restart httpd

# Clean up resources
rm -rf /tmp/webfiles
```

- More optimized, unzip to destination directory

```bash
unzip 2098_health.zip -d /var/www/html/
```

## Variables

 `websetup.sh`: refactored version

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

### ====== VARIABLES ======
PKG_MANAGER="yum"
PACKAGES=("wget" "unzip" "httpd")

SERVICE_NAME="httpd"

TMP_DIR="/tmp/webfiles"
ZIP_URL="https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2098_health.zip"
ZIP_FILE="2098_health.zip"
UNZIP_DIR="2098_health"

WEB_ROOT="/var/www/html"
### =======================

echo "▶ Installing packages..."
sudo $PKG_MANAGER install -y "${PACKAGES[@]}" >/dev/null

echo "▶ Starting & enabling service: $SERVICE_NAME"
sudo systemctl start $SERVICE_NAME
sudo systemctl enable $SERVICE_NAME

echo "▶ Preparing temp directory: $TMP_DIR"
mkdir -p "$TMP_DIR"
cd "$TMP_DIR"

echo "▶ Downloading template..."
wget "$ZIP_URL"

echo "▶ Extracting..."
unzip "$ZIP_FILE"

echo "▶ Deploying to web root: $WEB_ROOT"
sudo cp -r "$UNZIP_DIR"/* "$WEB_ROOT"

echo "▶ Restarting service..."
sudo systemctl restart $SERVICE_NAME

echo "▶ Cleaning up..."
rm -rf "$TMP_DIR"

echo "✅ Done!"

```

- **Advantages**:
	- `set -e`: fail fast, any command error (exitcode != 0) script stop immediately.
	- Pass arguement : `ZIP_URL=$1 UNZIP_DIR=$2`, run: ```bash ./websetup.sh https://example.com/site.zip mysite```
	- Array of needed packages: can extend when runtime `PACKAGES+=("curl")`

- More enhnace

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail

- **Advantages**:
	- Check OS (CentOS / Rocky / Alma / Ubuntu / Debian)
		```zsh
		❯ cat /etc/os-release
		PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 13 (trixie)"
		NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
		VERSION_ID="13"
		VERSION="13 (trixie)"
		VERSION_CODENAME=trixie
		DEBIAN_VERSION_FULL=13.2
		ID=debian
		HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
		SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
		BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"
		```

	- Auto detect package manager (`yum | dnf | apt`)
		- ```zsh
		command -v dnf
		command -v yum
		command -v apt
		```
	
	- Log to file -> `/var/log/web_deploy.log`
		- `exec > >(tee -a "$LOG_FILE") 2>&1`
			- **stdout**
			- **stderr**
			- **console**
			
	- Fail fast pro vip
		- `set -euo pipefail`: 
			- **-e**: if error stop
			- **-u**: any variable not set -> fail
			- **pipefail**: pipe fail -> fail
